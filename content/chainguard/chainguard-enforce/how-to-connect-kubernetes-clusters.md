Connecting Kubernetes clusters to Chainguard Enforce allows you to assess the current state of the supply chain of your containerized workloads and enforce policy once your workloads match your desired state. 


This guide outlines how to connect your Kubernetes clusters to Enforce using the [Chainguard Enforce Agent](/chainguard/chainguard-enforce/enforce-overview/#the-chainguard-enforce-agent).

## Chainguard Enforce Agent

The Enforce Agent is a flexible, general purpose way to connect your clusters to Chainguard Enforce. Clusters using the Enforce Agent are required to have [Service Account Token Volume Projection][k8s-docs-volume-projection] and [Service Account Issuer Discovery][k8s-docs-issuer-discover] enabled. 

[k8s-docs-volume-projection]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#service-account-token-volume-projection
[k8s-docs-issuer-discover]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#service-account-issuer-discovery

You can test that token volume projection is enabled by creating a pod with a projected volume. First create a service account.

You will first need to create a service account for your cluster if you have not done so already. The following example command creates a service account named `example-sa`.

```sh
kubectl create serviceaccount example-sa
```

Then run the following command to create a pod manifest named `pod.yaml`. Be sure to change the `serviceAccountName` value if yours is different from the given example.

```sh
cat <<EOF > pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: projection-test
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /var/run/secrets/tokens
      name: enforce-token
  serviceAccountName: example-sa
  volumes:
  - name: enforce-token
    projected:
      sources:
      - serviceAccountToken:
          path: enforce-token
          expirationSeconds: 7200
          audience: https://issuer.enforce.dev
EOF
```

Then, run the following command to create the pod.

```sh
kubectl create -f pod.yaml
```

Verify that it was created. 

```sh
kubectl get pods
```

If Service Account Token Volume Projection is functioning, you should receive the following output.

```
NAME              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
projection-test   1/1     Running   0          66s
```

If Service Account Token Volume Projection is not enabled the pod will be rejected.

To clean up, delete the pod.

```sh
kubectl delete -f pod.yaml
```

To check if your cluster has Service Account Issuer Discovery enabled you can check the issuer OIDC discovery endpoint

```sh
kubectl get --raw /.well-known/openid-configuration
```

If Service Account Issuer Discover is enabled, this command will return JSON output similar to the following.  

```json
{
  "issuer":"https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local",
  "jwks_uri":"https://172.19.0.2:6443/openid/v1/jwks",
  "response_types_supported":["id_token"],
  "subject_types_supported":["public"],
  "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported":["RS256"]
}
```

If it is not enabled, you will receive an error message similar to the following example. 

```text
Error from server (NotFound): the server could not find the requested resource
```

### How to connect a public cluster using Enforce Agent

If your cluster has a public API endpoint and the issuer discovery endpoints are accessible without authentication, your cluster is considered public. This is the default configuration of GKE and EKS clusters with public API endpoints.

You can check if your issuer discovery endpoints are public by using `curl`

```sh
curl "$(kubectl get --raw /.well-known/openid-configuration | jq .issuer -r)/.well-known/openid-configuration"
```

If the request succeeds, your cluster is public. If your cluster has a public endpoint, but the issuer discovery requires authentication, you can make it public by binding the `system:service-account-issuer-discovery` ClusterRole to the `system:unauthenticated` group.

```sh
kubectl create clusterrolebinding public-issuer-discovery \
  --clusterrole=system:service-account-issuer-discovery \
  --group=system:unauthenticated
```

To connect a public cluster to Chainguard Enforce, run the following command. 

```sh
chainctl cluster install
```

### How to connect a private cluster using Enforce Agent

If your cluster API endpoint isnâ€™t public, or the issuer discovery endpoints require authentication, you can still use the Chainguard Enforce Agent to connect your Kubernetes cluster. In this case your cluster is considered private and to connect you would run the following command.

```sh
chainctl cluster install --private
```

> Note: The agent does require network connectivity to our SaaS endpoints. If your cluster is running behind NAT, for example, the `--private` flag will work, but the agent will not work in an air-gapped environment.

#### Limitations of private clusters

When running in private clusters, the agent needs to be re-installed under two circumstances:

- If the service account issuer signing key is rotated 
- At least every 25 days

This is accomplished by running `chainctl cluster install --private` once again.
