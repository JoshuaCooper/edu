[Common vulnerabilities and exposures](/software-security/glossary/#cve), often referred to as "CVEs", are an increasingly frequent concern for both developers and consumers of software. A new CVE that appears in a widely-used application or a vulnerability scan with a large number of positive results would naturally be worrisome for developers, CISOs, and customers alike. 

There's no way to guarantee that your software will never be impacted by a CVE. After all, there are software vulnerabilities currently in existence that haven't even been discovered (known as [zero-day vulnerabilities](/software-security/glossary/#zero-day)). With that said, this conceptual article aims to highlight a few practices and strategies you and your team can use to reduce the risk of CVEs on your software.


## Understanding potential risks

An important step to minimizing your CVE risk is to understand their potential impacts and develop a sense of how CVEs can make their way into your applications.

One way you can do this is by keeping up to date with industry news. Software vulnerabilities and attacks have gained more attention from technology journalists. For example, the [Heartbleed](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160) vulnerability received widespread coverage when it was discovered in 2014, as did the [Log4Shell](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-44228) vulnerability in 2021. It also might be helpful to familiarize yourself with the various databases that list known CVEs and their exploitations, including the [CVE Program](https://www.cve.org/About/Overview) and the [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).

Bear in mind, just keeping up to date with industry news and recent CVEs won't prevent vulnerabilites from encroaching on your projects. After all, malicious actors could be exploiting a vulnerability in your code long before the CVE is discovered and reported. Having said that, understanding how vulnerabilities are discovered, categorized, and exploited can be useful when thinking about how to harden your system's defenses.

Another way to prepare yourself for the potential risks associated with CVEs is to have a plan in place for what you should do if new vulnerabilities affecting your software arise. It's becoming more common for organizations to develop a vulnerability response playbook. The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recently published a [Vulnerability Response Playbook](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Federal_Government_Cybersecurity_Incident_and_Vulnerability_Response_Playbooks_508C.pdf). The goal of this playbook is to provide a framework for Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies to help them identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. Although this playbook is meant specifically for organizations working with the federal government, the idea of having a plan in place ahead of a vulnerability is a great way to minimize the risk. 


## Maintaining dependency hygiene

Dependency hygiene is the practice of ensuring that the dependencies you introduce into your project do not contain vulnerabilities. We've found that many popular container images, when not updated, [will accumulate about one known vulnerability per day](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/enforce-against-vulnerability-sprawl-with-up-to-date-images). Many of the most widely used container images aren't updated regularly and past academic software engineering research has found that most images on Docker Hub, the most widely used container registry, have not been updated for over 120 days.

Some teams go so far as to actively avoid using dependencies, working under the belief that taking a "roll-your-own" approach to all their tooling is an effective way to reduce CVEs. Although first-party tools may report fewer CVEs when scanned, they won't be battle-tested like widely used open-source software, meaning there are drawbacks to this approach.


## Recommended tools

There are a number of tools available that allow you to scan your third party code for CVEs. At Chainguard, we use [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) to scan our own Chainguard Images, as it's open-source and it can scan Software Bills of Materials (or SBOMs). Additionally, Grype biases towards false positives over false negatives. This suits our needs, as we'd rather look into a vulnerability in one of our images that turns out to be a false positive than overlook a real vulnerability that impacts our customers.

Be aware that the results of a vulnerability scan can only tell you part of the story. Say, for example, that Project A has only a few dependencies while Project B has many. Logically, a vulnerability scan of Project A will likely return fewer results than one for Project B, but that doesn't mean that Project A is at any less of a risk. Although its results might show only a few CVEs, one of these vulnerabilities could still have a serious impact on Project A. Conversely, Project B's scan results might show a large number of CVEs, but most or all of these could be false positives. 

One tool that's useful for automating updates for your dependencies is [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot). Dependabot is a free tool offered by GitHub that sends alerts to repositories affected by new vulnerabilities and — if possible — raises a pull request to update the affected dependencies.

It's important to treat every new dependency you introduce into an application with a degree of scrutiny. Although the needs of every project vary, there are a number of practices a team can implement to ensure that they only use dependencies that meet certain requirements. As an example, you could integrate a tool like [Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/) into your organization's workflow.

Scorecard is an automated tool from the Open Source Security Foundation that performs a variety of security checks on software, returning a score between 1 and 10 for each one. These scores can help you understand what you need to work on to improve your project's security, and can also help you assess the security of your dependencies. 

[Chainguard Images](https://www.chainguard.dev/chainguard-images) are also helpful for minimizing your CVE risk. Many of Chainguard's images are distroless, meaning they contain only an application and its runtime dependencies. These images do not even contain a shell or package manager. Because Chainguard Images minimize the number of dependencies in this manner, they inherently contain few to zero CVEs. Also, Chainguard Images are rebuilt nightly to ensure images are completely up-to-date and contain all available security patches.

As mentioned in the introduction, there's no way to guarantee that no CVEs will affect your software. However, we hope that by reading this article you'll have learned some practical tips you can use to help minimize your exposure to vulnerabilities and keep your software secure.
