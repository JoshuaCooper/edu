Learn answers to your questions about [Chainguard Images](https://www.chainguard.dev/chainguard-images?utm_source=docs).

## Which Linux distribution is used as base for Chainguard Images?
Chainguard Images are based on [Wolfi](/open-source/wolfi/), a Linux _undistro_ we built specifically to address software supply chain security issues.
We do have some images with Alpine-based variants in order to support musl or unusual architectures.

## How do Chainguard Images relate to the Google Distroless Images?
The [Google distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) images follow a similar philosophy to many of our images: they are minimal images that don't include package managers or shells. The main difference is in the implementation. The Google distroless images are built with [Bazel](https://bazel.build) and based on the Debian distribution, whereas Chainguard Images are built with [apko](/open-source/apko) based on the [Wolfi](/open-source/wolfi) distribution. Wolfi is a community Linux [undistro](/open-source/wolfi/overview/#why-undistro). We believe our approach is more maintainable and extensible.

## What is an "undistro"?
We call Wolfi an undistro because unlike a typical Linux distribution, Wolfi is a stripped-down distribution designed for the cloud-native era. Most notably, we donâ€™t include a Linux kernel, instead relying on the environment (such as the container runtime) to provide this.

## Which images are available?

There are currently over 100 Chainguard Images available, which are segmented as **Public** or **Enterprise**. You can read more about this in the [next question](#what-options-do-i-have-to-use-chainguard-images).

To review all available Chainguard Images, you can check out the Chainguard Console at [https://console.enforce.dev/images/catalog](https://console.enforce.dev/images/catalog) (you will need to be logged in).

To review Public Chainguard Images, you can check out either the [Chainguard Images Reference Docs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/reference/) or the  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/chainguard-images).

Chainguard Images are available through the [Chainguard Registry](/chainguard/chainguard-images/registry/overview/).

## What is an SBOM and why is it important?
An SBOM is a Software Bill of Materials, which is a list containing detailed information about all software that is included within a software artifact, whether it's an application, a container image, or a physical appliance.

SBOMs provide visibility into the software you depend on. They can allow automated systems to quickly identify issues such as unpatched vulnerabilities, since SBOMs typically include the version of each dependency listed.

## Who maintains Chainguard Images?
[Chainguard Images](https://www.chainguard.dev/chainguard-images?utm_source=docs) are officially maintained by [Chainguard](https://chainguard.dev) employees, but they are also open source, which means any community member is welcome to suggest improvements.

## Can I simply replace my current base image with a Chainguard Image and it will work out of the box?
Chainguard Images are designed to be minimalist, and many of them don't come with a package manager. Depending on your stack and specific dependencies, you may need to include additional software by combining development images and our undistro images in a multi-stage Docker build.

## How often are Chainguard Images updated?
Chainguard Images are rebuilt every night to ensure that new package versions and security updates in upstream Wolfi are quickly applied.

## Do I need to authenticate into Chainguard to use Chainguard Images?
Logging in is optional if you are only using `:latest` and `:latest-dev` tags or image digests.

There are benefits for all users who authenticate to the Chainguard Registry, as Chainguard provides notifications of version updates, breaking changes, or critical security updates. However, users can continue to pull Images by digest or Images tagged `:latest` anonymously.

To learn how to authenticate into the Chainguard Registry, you can review our [authentication documentation](/chainguard/chainguard-images/registry/authenticating/). You can read more about the thought process behind authentication in our blog post, [Scaling Chainguard Images with a growing catalog and proactive security updates](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/scaling-chainguard-images-with-a-growing-catalog-and-proactive-security-updates).
